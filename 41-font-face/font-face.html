      <h1>Font face</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
      <ol>
        <li>Font file formates:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>WOFF2</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>EOT</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>OTF</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>SVG</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          WOFF and WOFF2 are good candidates to use in all browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The difference between @font-face and the other @-blocks are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              We don't need to give a name with @font-face
            </li>
            <li>Some @font-face need licence whereas other @-blocks don't need.</li>
            <li>
              @font-face cannot be declared within a CSS selector.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Licencing restrictions</b><br>
          This means that fonts cannot be used without permission from whose people who created the fonts.
        </li>
        <li>
          To supprort all those chosen fonts, we need to make the use of 8 font-face blocks
        </li>
        <li>
          Our users have to download 160KB in the example above.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we chose to offer WOFF2 as well as WOFF, we need to have need to specify both: <br>
          <u>Eg</u>:<br>
          <code>
            @font-face {<br>
              &nbsp; font-family: Roboto;<br>
              &nbsp; src: url('./Roboto.woff2') format(woff2),<br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; url('./Roboto.woff') format(woff);<br>
            }
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          To make sure the user's browser doesn't download the fonts they might already have, the user should try to find the <b>font</b> in the local system.<br> If it's not there, the user can download the font they don't have.
        </li>
        <li>
          when we assign <b>fallback fonts</b>, we had better be aware that <br>if it doesnâ€™t have fallback font available, it will keep going down to other fonts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>src</b> property can help the browser decide on which strategy to use in order to download something.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </nav>
  </body>
</html>
